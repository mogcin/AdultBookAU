### 1.3 Your payslip
1.3.1 When do you get it 

Pay slips - Fair Work Ombudsman 

1.3.2 What to check 

Amount paid out to you, withholding amount is correct 

1.4 Taxes 

1.4.1 Pay As You Go (PAYG) 

Part of your pay should be withheld and paid to the government by your employer when you get paid. You can refer to Tax tables | Australian Taxation Office to see how much you get withheld. The withholding amount basically assumes that you get paid the same thoughout the year, so you get withheld more if you get a larger pay once, but you can claim the excess back when you file your tax return after end of financial year which is after June. 

1.4.2 Tax Rates 

When you get paid more and move up a tax bracket, it does NOT mean ALL your pay 	get taxed more, only the PART that EXCEEDS the bracket get taxed more, except 	Medicare levy surcharge. See Tax rates – Australian resident | Australian Taxation 	Office for more up to date details.	 

1.5 Superannuation 

Super is keeping part of your earnings for retirement, when you start work you should be 	given a Superannuation standard choice form | Australian Taxation Office to fill out for the 	employer to pay into your super account. The account is mostly inaccessible until your 	retirement, but it is your money. Here is a video I found on Youtube Top 5 Superannuation 	Funds in Australia, though it might not be the most up to date, but it does give a brief intro  

into the superfund industry. This is not a recommendation of any funds or products. 

1.6 Tax Return 

If you work and make an income you most likely would need to file a tax return after end of 	financial year in June. You can either do it online How to lodge your tax return | Australian 	Taxation Office or find an accountant Public Register | Tax Practitioners Board to do it for 	you for a fee. 

1.7 Medicare Entitlement Statement 

	If you are not entitled to Medicare, you can apply for a Medicare Entitlement Statement 	after June and give it to your tax accountant. How to get a Medicare Entitlement Statement 	- Medicare Entitlement Statement - Services Australia 

 

Growing wealth 

2.1 Compounding Interest 

2.1.1 Rate 

One person has $1000, saves it for 20 years in a 5% annual interest rate savings account and doesn’t touch it, and another person starts saving 10 years later and deposits $200 regularly every year for 10 years and saving it in a 5% annual interest rate savings account. Even though the first person only contributed $1000, they still have more money than the second person that contributed $2000. The earlier you invest, the more it will grow.

2.2.2 Credit Cards 

2.2.3 Loans 

2.2.4 Credit Reports 

2.3 Savings 

2.3.1 Bank Accounts 

	You can compare interest rates here Compare High Interest Savings Accounts in 		Australia and Accounts Leaderboard - Google Sheets. Check if the bank or  

Authorized Deposit Institution is listed here List of authorised deposit-taking 		institutions covered under the Financial Claims Scheme | APRA, so that if in the 	event your account is with an ADI that went bust, you might be able to claim the 	money from the government. 

2.3.2 Debit Cards 

	You can keep the account that has a card linked to it separate from most of the 		money in another account, so that if your card get a fraudulent charge, you are more 		shielded and less likely your whole account gets drained. Best even if it is with a 		different ADI so you “forget” about it and will be less likely to spend it all. 

2.3.3 Payment Surcharges 

	Paying by tapping is convenient but there are surcharges, so either get a card that 

refunds some of the surcharges or withdraw cash to spend. 

2.4 Investing 

2.4.1 Brokers & AFS License 

	If you want to start investing, check here first ASIC Professional Registers Search 		and make sure the broker is licensed to provide financial services. 

2.4.2 Stock Exchanges 

Shares are pieces of company ownership, and it started as a way to share profits 

between the owners of the company and a way to share risk. Exchanges started as 	merely a place where owners could buy, sell, and exchange their ownership of a 	company or contracts. The first location was in the Netherlands. The main stock 	exchange in Australia is ASX. Other major exchanges can be found here List of 	major stock exchanges - Wikipedia 

2.4.3 CHESS vs Custodian 

When you buy shares, there are two models. 

Buying via a CHESS sponsored broker means that your ownership of shares will be 	recorded with ASX, and you will be able to get a buy/sell movement report at the end 	of the month electronically or online Electronic delivery of CHESS notifications. If 	the broker goes bust, you can just open an account at another broker can keep 	trading. But the minimum first buy into a share would generally be higher, no  

fractional shares, and generally higher commission to trade. 

If you buy shares under a custodian model, the shares would be under the broker’s 	name, and if the broker goes bust, they will need to sort out who owns what before 	they can give you back your assets. Share investments are often held by 		custodians. Who are they, what do they do and are they safe? - ABC News 

2.4.4 Share Registries 

	When you buy shares, you own a piece of the company so they need to know who 		owns them. Companies listed on a stock exchange would have hundreds or  

thousands or more shareholders, so they get another company to keep track of who 	owns the company. Share registry – what it is, how to find it 

After you have bought shares, you will need to look up which share registry they use 	and register with the registry, and download the tax statements at tax time.

Renting 

3.1 Where to look for 

If you are looking to rent a house, apartment,...etc to live in, try Domain.com.au | Real 	Estate & Properties For Sale & Rent and Search for Real Estate, Property & Homes - 	r	ealestate.com.au, though both will list very similar properties since most listings would be 	on both anyways. 

Looking for places to rent and doing inspections will take about 2 weeks, so you might want 	to factoring the cost of living in a hotel/hostel (which you can find on Google Maps) in the 	mean time. Moving alone costs $2000~$5000 up front, so really look for a place you like. 

A good estimate would be 10 weeks rent + $100/month utilities + moving costs. 

3.2 What to look out for 

3.2.1 Rents are mostly commonly priced by week in Australia 

3.2.2 NEVER pay until you have actually seen the property IN PERSON. Asking for a 	 

payment online using excuses as the owner is busy or unable to show up in person 	is a common scam not just in Australia, but also elsewhere like Europe. 

3.2.3 Most places for rent do not come with furniture unless stated that it is furnished. 		However, a furnished place means you will need to make sure you don’t break the 		furnitures or appliances. 

3.3 Open Inspections 

When you see a property you like, look for the next open inspection dates below the listing 	on the websites and just show up or contact the Real Estate Agent if you don’t see a date. 

Check the following during inspection and bring a soft tape measure: 

3.3.1 If it is close to amenities like grocers, clinics, shops, restaurants,... etc. 

3.3.2 If you are concerned about safety, avoid ground or level 1. 

3.3.3 Windows should preferably face north to get sunlight. 

3.3.4 The size and max height of the carpark should fit your car. 

3.3.5 Turning taps are more likely to have leaking/drip problems, mixers less so. 

3.3.6 If there is mold or water leaking signs, especially around the cupboards or closet. 

3.3.7 If it has aircon. 

3.3.8 Washer needs to fit within the laundry space. 

3.3.9 Fridge needs to fit in the kitchen. 

3.3.10 If there are enough mains sockets. 

3.3.11 At least 20A + 20A and independent lines in the main power switch. 

3.3.12 Might want to avoid windows/balcony facing road or tracks if noise bothers you. 

3.3.13 Think about how you will fit your bed/mattress, and your feet should not face a 		mirror, door, or window opening so you don’t frighten yourself at night or when you 		wake up.  

3.3.14 How much carpet/wooden flooring you like, as carpet is harder to clean and might 		cause allergy flareups. 

3.3.15 If there are stuff in the cupboards, as you will need to keep them as is when moving 		out in the future. 

3.3.16 If there is a building manager, which might be able to take deliveries for you. 

3.4 Filling Applications 

If you are interested, leave your name and number to the Real Estate Agent and they 		should text you afterwards. You will most likely need to provide copies of ID, bank 		statements to prove you have the funds, and references. 

3.5 Holding Deposit 

Once the REA sees your application, they might forward it to the owner. If the owner  

accepts your application, you will need to pay 1 week of the rent as a holding deposit  

before 	you sign the lease. If you don’t sign the lease within the set time period, they will 	take away the holding deposit and you will never see that money again. If you sign the  

rental agreement, the holding deposit goes to your first week of rent. 

After you let the REA know you have paid the holding deposit, they should start applying for 	NSW rental bonds online for you. 

3.6 NSW Rental Bonds Online 

Once the account has been opened, you will receive an email to pay your rental bonds  

from Tenant Login. Once you have paid, let the REA know. Once they have received the  

rental bond, they should arrange a time to give you the keys. 

3.7 Rental Agreement 

You can check the agreement provided by the Real Estate Agent and the Standard r		esidential tenancy agreement | NSW Government and see if there are any discrepancies. 	You will need to decide if those differences are acceptable or not, as once you sign the 	agreement you won’t be able to back out easily and you will need to fulfil your side of the 	promise. 

3.8 Utility Supplier 

If you have decided the move in date, go to Energy Made Easy and type in the address you  

are renting and choose your utility supplier for electricity and gas, continue with the sign up 	with utility company. 

3.9 Incoming Condition Report & Moving in 

Before moving in, the REA will give you an incoming condition report. It is best to do a walk  

thorough and take pictures if you see any markings or breakage and note it in the condition 

report so that the REA cannot claim against your rental bond when you move out in the 	future. See this video How To Do a Rental Property Walk-Through Inspection with VIDEO! 	on how to document for future reference, however the photos and written are stuff on the 	report is the most important.  

3.10 Moving out & Cleaning 

When you do move out, ask the REA to recommend you a cleaner, so if there are any stains 	they can talk to the cleaner they recommended, and you will be less likely to be contacted 	about the cleaning problems. You should also get a tenant ledger, and remember to save 	the receipt of your paid rents. 

3.11 Appliances & furniture 

Most rentals don’t come furnished, and these might be the things you will need to  

purchase if you don’t have them already, and account for an extra $1000 just in case:  

Laundry: Washer, Drying rack, Detergent 

Cooking: Fridge, Kettle, Pots, Pans, Utensils, Cooking oils, Condiments, Rice cooker 

Living: Cleaning supplies, Vacuum, Mattress, Beddings, Bed Rack, Chair, Toiletries, Formal 		Clothes, Towels, First Aid Kit (Betadine, Gauzes, Bandaid), Electric Fan 

 

Health 

4.1 Getting Individual Healthcare Identifiers (IHI) 

You can logon to MyGov to get an IHI, when you get vaccines, you will either need to  

give them your Medicare card or IHI to upload the vaccine to the registry. 

How to get an Individual Healthcare Identifier - Individual Healthcare Identifiers - Services 	Australia	 

4.2 Insurance 

Insurance is essentially a group of people pooling money together and when one of the 	members need to pay for a service they cannot afford, the group pays together for them. 

You should consider 	insurance before you are in trouble. Insurance is a premium you pay 	forward, you generally cannot pay after you have already gotten in trouble. 

Here is a list of things to look out for before joining an insurance plan: 

4.2.1 What is covered: Hospital, Extras, or other personal requirements  

4.2.2 Waiting Period: People cannot pay for insurance just before they see a dentist then 				leaves the insurance plan afterwards. 

4.2.3 Annual Limits: How much insurance will pay for you on certain services every year. 

4.2.4 Hospital Excess: How much you need to pay out of pocket before you can claim for 				insurance. 

4.2.5 What is not covered: What you cannot claim for insurance, you will need to pay for all 				of it out of pocket. 

4.2.6 Extra claim %: How much percentage you can claim towards a procedure. 

4.2.7 If you drive, look up on Third Party Property Damage, too. 

4.3 Going to GP 

Call or go to the clinic’s website to book a consultation. If it is bulk-billing, you will need to 	bring your corresponding Medicare card with you when you get there. If it is the first time 	you go the clinic, you will also likely need to fill out a form with your details. There might be 	out of pocket cost for some doctors, and if your insurance plan covers 150% MBS (check 	how much each item on MBS is MBS Online - The MBS), take a photo of the payment 	invoice and claim with your insurance. 

4.4 Dentist	 

Call or go to the dental practice’s website to book a check-up and consultation. 

A lot of private dental clinics will partner with a lot of different insurance, you can just give 	them your insurance member card, and after swiping they will tell you how much you need 	to pay out of pocket, it is claimed against your insurance on the spot. 

4.5 Vaccines 

	You can check the vaccines you should have here Catch-up vaccination for adolescents 	and adults | The Australian Immunisation Handbook as an adult. And here is a list of	extra 	vaccines go might be able to get Vaccination for special risk groups | The Australian 		Immunisation Handbook. Please consult with your GP on what you can or cannot get.

		5.5.2 Tickets & Seats 

			You can look up flights on search engines and book them via the airline or other 			travel agents. If you can choose your seats, go to Airline Seat Maps, Flights 				shopping and Flight information- Best Airplane Seats - SeatGuru to check the pros 			and cons of each seat on your flight.

plane if they need to though.

be in the on-board luggage as well. 

		5.5.4 Arrive Early 

The departure time on the plane ticket is when the plane is scheduled to leave, and 

you should arrive earlier than that to go through check-in, security, border and such.	Look up on the airline’s website on when you should be at the airport. 

		5.5.5 Controls

departing and arrival at your destination. 

		5.5.6 Customs
